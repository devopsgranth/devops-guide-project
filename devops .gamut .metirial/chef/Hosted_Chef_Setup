# Create an administrator user and generate user key
Syntax: $ chef-server-ctl user-create USER_NAME FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME EMAIL 'PASSWORD' --filename FILE_NAME


ex:
sudo chef-server-ctl user-create nageshvkn Nageswara Rao nageshvkn@gmail.com 'nageshvkn' --filename Certs/nageshvkn.pem

	- This creates an RSA private key. This is the users private key. save it to some location.
	
#Create an Organization and generate Chef validator key
Syntax: $ chef-server-ctl org-create short_name 'full_organization_name' --association_user user_name --filename ORGANIZATION-validator.pem

ex:
sudo chef-server-ctl org-create gamutkart 'gamut_gurus_technologies' --association_user nageshvkn --filename Certs/gamutkart-validator.pem

	- shortname naming convention: Better give small letters, _ and - digit and start the organization name with lower case letters for your organization name.
	- Full name can have space, 
	- The --association_user option will associate the user_name with the admins security group on the Chef server.
	- An RSA private key is generated automatically. This is the chef-validator key
