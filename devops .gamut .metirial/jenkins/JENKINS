1. What is continuos integration and Continuous Delivery C.I/C.D?

	- C.I integration is nothing but continous compilation, testing and deployment.
	- C.I is a process which monitors the new changes coming to V.C.S like Git, checkouts the source code, builds the change, runs the test case to test the change and deploys it to given environment automatically (seemlessly) without any manual intervention.

2. Why we need continous Integration?
	Refer c.i feature.

3. Have you created jenkins job or just worked on existing jenkins environment? 
- How do you create a new build/jenkins job?

4. How do you install jenkins? What are the different ways?
	1. java -jar jenkins.war  [http://localhost:8080] [uses jetty server]
	2. yum install jenkins[RHEL] OR apt-get install jenkins
													[Ubuntu]
	3. Deploy jenkins.war in tomcat like any other web applications. [Production approach]

5. How do you setup a crontab in linux?
	Note: Refer Google and setup a simple crontab.
  - creating a new crontab.	
	crontab -e
		====
		* * * * * `command/any script`
		Minute   Hour	 DOM	 Month  DOW	
		0-59	 0-23	1-31	1-12	0-7
		====
  - list all crontabs
	crontab -l
  - remove all crontabs
	crontab -r

6. How do you migrate jenkins from one server to another?
	- Install Jenkins in the new machine.
	- Copy .jenkins to new machine's $USER_HOME dir.
	- Start jenkins server in the new machine.
	[ Note: Usually, we don't copy workspace from old jenkins server to new as it contains large size of source code.]
	[command to exclude workspace.
		tar --exclude=workspace -cvf jenkins.tar .jenkins]

7. How do you start/stop jenkins?

8. Jenkins is running some jobs and I want to restart it. How do you restart?
   - How do you restart the jenkins without interrupting running jobs?

9. What is the default port number of jenkins?

10. How do you change the port number of Jenkins?
	Go to $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml
	Change port number in this line: [ port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" ] 

11. How do you check Jenkins logs?

12. How do you check your Application logs?

13. What challenges you faced while working with Jenkins?
	- What are the common issues you see in Jenkins?
		- compilation
		- deployment
		- jdk or maven installation
		- disk space
		- port change

14. Where does Jenkins store global and job related configurations?
	Global configurations: $JENKINS_HOME/.jenkins/config.xml
	Job configurations: $JENKINS_HOME/.jenkins/jobs/job_name/config.xml

15. Where Jenkins stores all plugins data?
	$JENKINS_HOME/.jenkins/plugins

16. I want to modify JDK version from 1.7 to 1.8 in 1000 jobs? How do you do it?
	Jenkins stores all configuration data in .jenkins/jobs/
	job_name/config.xml
	we can find 1.7 in all config.xml and replace it with 
	1.8 using some linux command or small script.
	Then to load the changes, we need to run "Reload configurations from disk"

17. How did you setup build and deployment for your project?
	- we call deploy.sh in post build section of jenkins.
	
	Deployment scritpt steps:
		- before copying the war file, our script checks 
		  for diskspace.
		- copy war file to all tomcat servers in an environment(copy using scp)
		- shutdown the tomcat
		- start the tomcat
18. How many builds you store in your jenkins.
	How do you rotate logs for your Jenkins? 

19. How do you backup your jenkins data?

20. How do you configure different jenkins jobs to run with different JDKs?

21. What is the difference between "Build periodically"  and "Poll scm"?

22. How do you configure security for your jenkins? Are you using LDAP for authentication?

23. What is matrix based security? How do you provide access to your users?

24. What is a plugin?
	What plugins you installed? Name few plugins which you have used?
====
1. Thin Backup -
Using Cron tab style/notion, we can schedule the backups for jenkins. We usually take backup for Jenkins home directory. Once we install this plugin, It adds "ThinBackup" section to manage jenkins.

2. Email-ext plugin/Editable Email notification:
    This is advanced plugin for Jenkins default email notification plugin
    Using this plugin, we can create our own email subject, body and
    also attach log or any file while sending the emails to users.

3. Configure History plugin:
Check job configuration history for example who deleted a job or configuration, who modifed jdk, trigger schedule, user addition/deletion..etc. Once we install this plugin, we can see who has done what or who made what changes. It records the history of all user's modifications.

4. Shelve project:
    If we have large size of build log files, un-used jenkins jobs, Jenkins will become slow(as it has to scan all projects for generating reports). So, It's good idea to archive any un-used jenkins jobs so that jenkins don't scan the project. since this plugin archives the projects, we can restore them if we want in the future.

5. Junit
====

25. What are the different ways of installing a plugin?

26. What is "Reload configurations from the Disk"? when do you use this?

27. How do you take back up for only jobs? excluding WS?

28. How do you set up distributed builds?

29. How many slave nodes you have?

30. What is a label?
    Label is a virtual name for one or more slave nodes using which we can tie a particular jenkins job to always run on a pariticular machine (Usually which has jdk6 or jdk8 or windows machine...etc.)

31. what kind of problems you faced with your jenkins so far?
        - Our Master server became slow. So to distribute the load, I implemented master/slave concept and today our builds are running in 4 slave nodes.
        - Regular compile / deployment issues.
		- Diskspace issues.

32. Suddenly my Jenkins instance became slow. What steps you do you take to improve the performance?
		- clean up old jobs. may be by using shelve plguing
		- implement master/slave distributed concept.
		- may be improve the computing power for ex: RAM 	
			and CPU
		- Make sure your Master doesn't run any jobs. Just 
			keep it for serving jenkins trafic and schedule 
			all your builds in slave nodes.

33. how much you rate yourself in jenknins?

34. Do you have experience with .Net builds?

35. How do you upgrade jenkins?
	- take a test machine
	- install the same old version of jenkins in the new 
		machine.
	- copy .jenkins from old jenkins to new and bring the 
		new jenkins server up
	- run 'reload configurations from disk'	
	- test few builds randomly in new Jenkins if everything 
	works well as old jenkins
	-  finally repeat the same in production/original 
		server.

36. Can you name few Jenkins Features?
    - Jenkins is process improvment tool
    - using jenkins we can compile, run tests, build the code and deploy efficiently by continuously integrating users changes with existing application.
    - we can generate graps, statistics for our builds and test cases,
    - jenkins provides fast feed back when some thing goes wrong.
    - jenkins is plugin based and rich in features to we mostly get everyting which solves our requirements.
    - jenkins can act as a nice reporting tool. it sends test case and any other report in html format with some nice colors.
    - helps to deliver the code to production very quickly with quality code by running the test cases.
    - allows us to run builds in parellel. so builds can run faster.
    - allows us to run different builds with different confiugrations seemlesly without much configuration complexity.

37. How do you setup Jenkins from scratch?

38. What are the prerequisites for Jenkins?

39. how do you deploy an application in tomcat?
    can you explain how the deployment happens for your 
	project?
        - we build war file as a final artifact
        - we have shell script for deployment.
		- It checks if tomcat/target machine is up and 
			running and has enough free disk space
        - it does shutdown the server 
        - copies the war file to webapps location
        - starts the server.
		- It also sends the email notifications to all users

40. What is the deference between web server and application server?
	web server serves static content: ex..
		html
		images
		javascript
	application server serves dynamic content:
		search results
		date conversion
		shipment calculation

41. What is the parameterised build job? How do you set it up?

42. What is build pipeline? have you created build pipelines?
